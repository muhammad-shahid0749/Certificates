        "It was in January of 2021 that **OpenAI** announced two new models: **DALL-E** and **CLIP**, both **multi-modality** models connecting **texts and images** in some way. In this article we are going to implement CLIP model from scratch in **PyTorch**. OpenAI has open-sourced some of the code relating to CLIP model but I found it intimidating and it was far from something short and simple. I also came across a good tutorial inspired by CLIP model on Keras code examples and I translated some parts of it into PyTorch to build this tutorial totally with our beloved PyTorch!"

        "In [Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), OpenAI introduces their new model which is called **CLIP**, for **Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training**. In a nutshell, this model learns the relationship between a whole sentence and the image it describes; in a sense that when the model is trained, given an input sentence it will be able to retrieve the most related images corresponding to that sentence. The important thing here is that it is trained on full sentences instead of single classes like car, dog, etc. The intuition is that when trained on whole sentences, the model can learn a lot more things and finds some pattern between images and texts.\n",
        "They also show that when this model is trained on a huge dataset of images and their corresponding texts, it can also act as a classifier too. I encourage you to study the paper to learn more about this exciting model and their astonishing results on benchmarking datasets . To mention just one, CLIP model trained with this strategy classifies ImageNet better than those SOTA models trained on the ImageNet itself optimized for the only task of classification!"

Why I did not use it here? For 2 reasons. 1- The dataset we are using has multiple captions for a single image; so, there is the possibility that two identical images with their similar captions exist in a batch (it is rare but it can happen). Taking the loss with this easier method will ignore this possibility and the model learns to pull apart two representations (assume them different)  that are actually the same. Obviously, we don't want this to happen so I calculated the whole target matrix in a way that takes care of these edge cases. 2- Doing it the way I did, gave me a better understanding of what is happening in this loss function; so, I thought it would give you a better intuition as well!"
